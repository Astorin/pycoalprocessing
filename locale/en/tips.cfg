[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
	intro=Welcome to Pyanodon's Mods. Depending on which mods of the set you have installed, parts of factorio have been changed. Pyanodon's mods are intended for a long playthru and generally not considered a mod set for beginners or those looking for a short game.\n\nThe Pyanodon mods can be used in many combinations, but there are three recommended 'packs' for Pyanodon: "ShortPy", "MediumPy" and "FullPy". ShortPy consists of the Coal Processing, Industry, and Fusion Energy mods. MediumPy adds Raw Ores, Petroleum Handling and HighTech to the mix. FullPy adds AlienLife and Alternative Energy. Roughly speaking, you can expect ShortPy to take about a hundred hours to finish, MediumPy several hundred hours and FullPy over a thousand hours.\n\nNote that Pyanodon is not balanced for biters at the moment, and it is recommended you play without them.\n\nPyanodon does not work well with other large overhaul mods like Bob's, Angel's, K2 or SE, so it is not recommended to combine them.\n\nIt is possible to play Pyanodon with or without the RSO mod. Some people turn up the richness of ore patches, but you generally don't need that many ores aside from the early game. Play the game the way you like it.\n\nSeveral tips have been added to the game, most of which will pop up when you research the relevant tech.
	victory=In Pyanodon's the victory condition has changed. To win you need to research the technology [technology=pyrrhic].
    themes-tips=There are several principles that apply to all Pyanodon mods:\n- there are (eventually) several ways to make an item, pick the method most suitable for your current factory and playstyle.\n- buildings have significant resource requirements. Unlike vanilla, a lot of your factory will produce items that are only used in buildings, not just in science\n- you generally get bad recipes first, but as your tech level increases, your recipes will become many times more efficient. Trust us, it's very satisfying to be swimming in iron plates when the initial iron plate recipe needs 8 iron ore. Of course, better recipes are usually also more complex...\n\nSome tips when playing:\n- automate one thing at a time. The task "automate the entire next science pack" is huge, and can lead to burn-out. Just pick something that sounds useful to have a lot of, and automate it.\n- don't overbuild early on. Any amount per second is often a good start. Most people start with 0.1 science packs per second. Especially for items used in buildings only, having just a trickle of items will go a long way. A Pyanodon game is long, you can work on other things while a buffer is building up.\n - at the opposite end of the spectrum: automation trumps handcrafting. You could handcraft all the buildings you need for your entire run, but making a mall for at least the most common items will save a lot of frustration, which can in turn also lead to burnout. Automating a nonzero amount gets you a long way in Pyanodon.
    mechanical-inserter=The burner inserter is now an [item=burner-inserter]. Unlike in the base game, it does not need to be fueled. It's speed is around 0.6 items per second. It now also functions as a filter inserter, so you can whitelist or blacklist one item.\n\n[item=inserter] also gets a filter slot, has a speed of 1.2 items per second, but still needs electricity.\n\n[item=long-handed-inserter] moves 1.2 items per second, and is unchanged otherwise.\n\n[item=fast-inserter] and [item=filter-inserter] move 2.4 items per second, and are unchanged otherwise.
    ash=Most inorganic fuels such as [item=coal] now produce [item=ash] when burnt, much like how [item=uranium-fuel-cell] produces [item=used-up-uranium-fuel-cell] on consumption. You can consult the Py wiki in the top left corner of the screen to see all the burnt results for all fuels. Most organic fuels don't produce ash, so you can try to use them for ash-free production. You will usually unlock electric means of production too. Remember that ash can be very useful though...\n\nOne example is the assembly machine (now [item=assembling-machine-1]), which now requires fuel. You will unlock [item=automated-factory-mk01] before long though, which uses electricity at the cost of a larger and more expensive building.\n\n[item=assembling-machine-1] also has a recipe limit now: only recipes with at most 3 ingredients can be used by this building. [item=assembling-machine-2] has a limit of 4, and [item=assembling-machine-3] of 5 ingredients, while [item=automated-factory-mk01] has no ingredient limit.
    tailings-pond=The [item=tailings-pond] has different mechanisms depending on whether you put a gas or a liquid into it.\n\nGasses, such as [fluid=coal-gas], are vented into the atmosphere, which destroys the gas.\n\nFluids, such as [fluid=tar], are stored, until the tailings pond is full, at which point the pond overflows. This destroys the contents, and puts a ring of highly flammable pollution tiles around the tailings pond. You can remove fluids from the pond again by connecting a pump directly to one of the outputs.
    early-game-tips=Here are some early game tips:\n - watch out that you need two [item=boiler] per [item=steam-engine] now!\n - you need [item=steam-engine] for a lot of buildings, so it could be great to add it to an early game mall.\n - yes, the new labs are very tall. There can be things behind them, take care!
    your-first-science-pack=The first science pack ([item=automation-science-pack]) is much harder than in vanilla. You'll have to handcraft a few of them before you can fully automate it. These are the steps you have to take:\n- put [item=coal] through [item=distilator] to get [item=coke], [fluid=tar] and [fluid=coal-gas]. The latter two can be used as fuel for [item=glassworks-mk01] (you can make two of them, one using [fluid=tar] as fuel and one [fluid=coal-gas]).\n- Turn [fluid=water] into [item=fawogae], and combine with [item=coke] into [item=fawogae-substrate].\n- turn [fluid=water] into [item=soil] into [item=sand] into [fluid=molten-glass]. You can't use the [fluid=dirty-water-light] for now, so either remove it manually from the pipes, use [item=tailings-pond] or down the line use the Py sinkhole (if you use the Pyanodon Industry mod), or use some other mod to void it.\n- turn [fluid=molten-glass] into [item=flask] with [item=wood]. You can't automate wood yet until [technology=wood-processing], so you have to chop down trees manually for now.\n- craft [item=automation-science-pack], and profit!
    techs=Tips and tricks related to techs will come here.
    combustion-mixture=You can make [fluid=combustion-mixture1] in [item=power-house]. You can then burn this in [item=gasturbinemk01] for electricity. There are different recipes for [fluid=combustion-mixture1], with two important properties: how much is generated, and at what temperature. Higher temperatures mean that the turbine works at a higher efficiency, thus generating more power. For example, [fluid=syngas] generates more [fluid=combustion-mixture1] at a higher temperature than [fluid=coal-gas], so it will generate more electricity for the same amount of input.\n\n[item=gasturbinemk01] has a limit to the temperature it can accept: if you give it a higher temperature input, it will be capped to that temperature, so you will be wasting the input. Higher level turbines such as [item=gasturbinemk02] and [item=gasturbinemk03] have higher caps.\n\nPick the input you have the most of, or that you have the least other uses for, and use it to power your base that way. If you want to calculate the exact amount of electricity generated, you can use a mod like Helmod or Factory Planner, or a program like YAFC.\n\nCreating [fluid=combustion-mixture1] also generates low temperature steam. You can use cooling towers to turn it back into water, or you can vent it, or you can put the steam into steam engines, although they will only give a small amount of electricity.
