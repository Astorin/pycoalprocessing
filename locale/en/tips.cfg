[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
    intro=Welcome to Pyanodon's Mods. Depending on which mods of the set you have installed, parts of factorio have been changed. Pyanodon's mods are intended for a long playthru and generally not considered a mod set for beginners or those looking for a short game.

    victory=In Pyanodon's the victory condition has changed. To win you need to research the technology [technology=pyrrhic].

    coalprocessing=These are the tips specific to Pyanodon's Coal Processing. Tips specific to certain techs will appear as you research them.
    ash=Most inorganic fuels such as [item=coal] now produce [item=ash] when burnt, much like how [item=uranium-fuel-cell] produces [item=used-up-uranium-fuel-cell] on consumption. You can consult the Py wiki in the top left corner of the screen to see all the burnt results for all fuels.
    mechanical-inserter=The burner inserter is now an [item=burner-inserter]. Unlike in the base game, it does not need to be fueled. It's speed is around 0.6 items per second. It now also functions as a filter inserter, so you can whitelist or blacklist one item.\n\n[item=inserter] also gets a filter slot, has a speed of 1.2 items per second, but still needs electricity.\n\n[item=long-handed-inserter] moves 1.2 items per second, and is unchanged otherwise.\n\n[item=fast-inserter] and [item=filter-inserter] move 2.4 items per second, and are unchanged otherwise.
    assembling-machine=The assembly machine (now [entity=assembling-machine-1]) now requires fuel. It also has an ingredient limit now: only recipes with at most 3 ingredients can be used by this building. [entity=assembling-machine-2] has a limit of 4, and [entity=assembling-machine-3] of 5 ingredients, while [entity=automated-factory-mk01] has no ingredient limit.
    tailings-pond=The [entity=tailings-pond] has different mechanisms depending on whether you put a gas or a liquid into it.\n\nGasses, such as [fluid=coal-gas], are vented into the atmosphere, which destroys the gas.\n\nLiquids, such as [fluid=tar], are stored, until the tailings pond is full, at which point the pond overflows. This destroys the contents, and puts a ring of highly flammable pollution tiles around the tailings pond. You can remove fluids from the pond again (if it hasn't overflowed) by connecting a pump directly to one of the outputs.
    combustion-mixture=You can burn [fluid=combustion-mixture1] in [entity=gasturbinemk01] for electricity. Higher temperatures of the fluid mean that the turbine works at a higher efficiency, thus generating more power. [entity=gasturbinemk01] has a limit to the temperature it can accept: if you give it a higher temperature input than this limit, it will be capped to that temperature, so you will be wasting the input. Higher level turbines have higher limits.
