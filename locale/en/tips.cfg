[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
    intro=Welcome to Pyanodon's Mods. Depending on which mods of the set you have installed, parts of factorio have been changed. Pyanodon's mods are intended for a long playthru and generally not considered a mod set for beginners or those looking for a short game.
    
    before-first-game=This section has some recommendations for your first Py game.
    recommended-settings=It is recommended you turn biters off, as the modpack is not balanced for them. You can then turn off pollution to save UPS.\n\nSome people turn up the richness of ores, to avoid having to migrate to new ore patches. However, after the early game you generally don't need a lot of ore, so the default richness settings are definitely playable. Especially with AlienLife, there are plenty of renewable sources for all ores in the later game too.
    recommended-mod-combinations=There are currently eight Pyanodon mods. They are described on their portal pages. The Pyanodon mods can be used in many combinations, but there are three recommended 'packs' for Pyanodon:\n- "ShortPy", which consists of just the Coal Processing, Industry, and Fusion Energy mods. You can expect a game to take around a hundred hours.\n- "MediumPy", which adds Raw Ores, Petroleum Handling and HighTech to ShortPy. You can expect a game to take hundreds of hours.\n- "FullPy", which adds AlienLife and Alternative Energy to MediumPy. It should take over a thousand hours.
    recommended-other-mods=Pyanodon's mods generally work well with quality of life mods. It is perfectly playable without them, but by default it does not offer many quality of life improvements. You can use other mods to tailor your game to your own taste.\n\nIt is recommended to have a mod such as Recipe Book, FNEI, or What is it really used for?, to help navigate the modpack.\n\nIt is possible to play Pyanodon with or without the RSO mod, so that's up to personal preference. There are not too many starting ores any more, so default ore generation should be playable.\n\nPyanodon does not work well with other large overhaul mods like Bob's, Angel's, K2 or SE, so it is not recommended to combine them.\n\nWatch out with the Nanobots mod, it currently causes issues with farm buildings in the AlienLife mod.
    
    general-py-tips=These are tips applicable to all Pyanodon's mods    
    victory=In Pyanodon's the victory condition has changed. To win you need to research the technology [technology=pyrrhic].
    themes=There are several themes or principles that apply to all Pyanodon mods:\n- there are (eventually) several ways to make an item, pick the method most suitable for your current factory and playstyle.\n- buildings have significant resource requirements. Unlike vanilla, a lot of your factory will produce items that are only used in buildings, not just in science\n- you generally get bad recipes first, but as your tech level increases, your recipes will become many times more efficient. Trust us, it's very satisfying to be swimming in iron plates when the initial iron plate recipe needs 8 iron ore. Of course, better recipes are usually also more complex...
    general-tips=Some tips for how to get the most fun out of the modpack:\n- automate one thing at a time. The task "automate the entire next science pack" is huge, and can lead to burn-out. Just pick something that sounds useful to have a lot of, and automate it.\n- don't overbuild early on. Any amount per second is often a good start. Most people start with 0.1 science packs per second. Especially for items used in buildings only, having just a trickle of items will go a long way. A Pyanodon game is long, you can work on other things while a buffer is building up.\n- at the opposite end of the spectrum: automation trumps handcrafting. You could handcraft all the buildings you need for your entire run, but making a mall for at least the most common items will save a lot of frustration, which can in turn also lead to burnout. Automating a nonzero amount gets you a long way in Pyanodon.
    py-technologies=There are some new aspects to researching technologies in Pyanodon:\n- the Pyanodon Post-processing mod ensures that if a technology gives you a recipe, you will have the means to use the recipes. No more "great, I can make X if I have Y, but I can't make Y until several technologies later..."\n- deeper technologies cost more tech to build. You may need to upgrade your science production as you unlock more techs, which should make that easier.\n- more advanced science packs cost increasing amount of the lower tier science packs. Compare for example [technology=logistic-science-pack] and [technology=chemical-science-pack]. As a result, you will need to upgrade your lower tier science pack production as you get further in the game.\n- [item=utility-science-pack] now requires [item=production-science-pack].\n- AlienLife introduces four new science packs, to smoothen science progression.

    coalprocessing=These are the tips specific to Pyanodon's Coal Processing. Tips specific to certain techs will appear as you research them.
    mechanical-inserter=The burner inserter is now an [item=burner-inserter]. Unlike in the base game, it does not need to be fueled. It's speed is around 0.6 items per second. It now also functions as a filter inserter, so you can whitelist or blacklist one item.\n\n[item=inserter] also gets a filter slot, has a speed of 1.2 items per second, but still needs electricity.\n\n[item=long-handed-inserter] moves 1.2 items per second, and is unchanged otherwise.\n\n[item=fast-inserter] and [item=filter-inserter] move 2.4 items per second, and are unchanged otherwise.
    ash=Most inorganic fuels such as [item=coal] now produce [item=ash] when burnt, much like how [item=uranium-fuel-cell] produces [item=used-up-uranium-fuel-cell] on consumption. You can consult the Py wiki in the top left corner of the screen to see all the burnt results for all fuels. Most organic fuels don't produce ash, so you can try to use them for ash-free production. You will usually unlock electric means of production too. Remember that ash can be very useful though...\n\nOne example is the assembly machine (now [item=assembling-machine-1]), which now requires fuel. You will unlock [item=automated-factory-mk01] before long though, which uses electricity at the cost of a larger and more expensive building.\n\n[item=assembling-machine-1] also has a recipe limit now: only recipes with at most 3 ingredients can be used by this building. [item=assembling-machine-2] has a limit of 4, and [item=assembling-machine-3] of 5 ingredients, while [item=automated-factory-mk01] has no ingredient limit.
    tailings-pond=The [item=tailings-pond] has different mechanisms depending on whether you put a gas or a liquid into it.\n\nGasses, such as [fluid=coal-gas], are vented into the atmosphere, which destroys the gas.\n\nFluids, such as [fluid=tar], are stored, until the tailings pond is full, at which point the pond overflows. This destroys the contents, and puts a ring of highly flammable pollution tiles around the tailings pond. You can remove fluids from the pond again by connecting a pump directly to one of the outputs.
    early-game-tips=Here are some early game tips:\n- watch out that you need two [item=boiler] per [item=steam-engine] now!\n- you need [item=steam-engine] for a lot of buildings, so it could be great to add it to an early game mall.\n- yes, the new labs are very tall. There can be things behind them, take care!
    your-first-science-pack=The first science pack ([item=automation-science-pack]) is much harder than in vanilla. You'll have to handcraft a few of them before you can fully automate it. These are the steps you have to take:\n- put [item=coal] through [item=distilator] to get [item=coke], [fluid=tar] and [fluid=coal-gas]. The latter two can be used as fuel for [item=glassworks-mk01] (you can make two of them, one using [fluid=tar] as fuel and one [fluid=coal-gas]).\n- Turn [fluid=water] into [item=fawogae], and combine with [item=coke] into [item=fawogae-substrate].\n- turn [fluid=water] into [item=soil] into [item=sand] into [fluid=molten-glass]. You can't use the [fluid=dirty-water-light] for now, so either remove it manually from the pipes, use [item=tailings-pond] or down the line use the Py sinkhole (if you use the Pyanodon Industry mod), or use some other mod to void it.\n- turn [fluid=molten-glass] into [item=flask] with [item=wood]. You can't automate wood yet until [technology=wood-processing], so you have to chop down trees manually for now.\n- craft [item=automation-science-pack], and profit!
    combustion-mixture=You can make [fluid=combustion-mixture1] in [item=power-house]. You can then burn this in [item=gasturbinemk01] for electricity. There are different recipes for [fluid=combustion-mixture1], with two important properties: how much is generated, and at what temperature. Higher temperatures mean that the turbine works at a higher efficiency, thus generating more power. For example, [fluid=syngas] generates more [fluid=combustion-mixture1] at a higher temperature than [fluid=coal-gas], so it will generate more electricity for the same amount of input.\n\n[item=gasturbinemk01] has a limit to the temperature it can accept: if you give it a higher temperature input, it will be capped to that temperature, so you will be wasting the input. Higher level turbines such as [item=gasturbinemk02] and [item=gasturbinemk03] have higher caps.\n\nPick the input you have the most of, or that you have the least other uses for, and use it to power your base that way. If you want to calculate the exact amount of electricity generated, you can use a mod like Helmod or Factory Planner, or a program like YAFC.\n\nCreating [fluid=combustion-mixture1] also generates low temperature steam. You can use cooling towers to turn it back into water, or you can vent it, or you can put the steam into steam engines, although they will only give a small amount of electricity.
